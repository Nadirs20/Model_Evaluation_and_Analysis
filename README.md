Model Evaluation and Analysis WorkflowThis project utilizes IBM SPSS Modeler to create a structured data science workflow focusing on model development, evaluation, and performance analysis. The stream file automates the process of data transformation and predictive analytics.Project OverviewThe primary objective of this project is to build an end-to-end analytical pipeline that prepares raw data for modeling and evaluates the results using various statistical metrics. It ensures that the model is both robust and accurate before deployment.Key Objectives:Design an automated data flow for predictive modeling.Implement data cleaning and transformation nodes to prepare features.Evaluate model performance using Gain charts, Lift charts, and Analysis nodes.Compare multiple algorithms to identify the most effective predictive model.Technical Workflow1. Data Ingestion and PreprocessingImporting datasets from source nodes (CSV, Excel, or Database).Handling missing values and filtering irrelevant features.Defining data types and target variables using Type nodes.2. Modeling PhaseApplying various algorithms such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, or Regression.Partitioning data into training and testing sets to prevent overfitting.3. Evaluation and AnalysisUsing the Analysis node to check accuracy and error rates.Visualizing model effectiveness through Evaluation charts (Gains, Lift, and Response).Interpreting predictor importance to understand key drivers of the model.Tech StackIBM SPSS Modeler (Stream architecture)Statistical AnalysisPredictive AnalyticsUsageOpen IBM SPSS Modeler.Navigate to File > Open Stream and select Model_Evaluation_and_Analysis.str.Ensure the source data paths are correctly configured to point to your local data files.Execute the stream to view the model results and evaluation outputs.Repository StructureFileDescriptionModel_Evaluation_and_Analysis.strSPSS Modeler stream file containing the full analytical workflow.
